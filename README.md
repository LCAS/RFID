#Building from source

The code is built from source from the install shell script. Alternatively the makefile can be used, but these will not be installed, instead placed in the lib folder.

The shared object Mercury Library file can be compiled by
downloading the source from the ThingMagic website, and compiling with 
these commands. A compiled version is already provided in this directory, 
in accordance with the ThingMagic License.
